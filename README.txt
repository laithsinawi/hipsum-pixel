Creates a button on the WordPress editor toolbar to insert a configurable amount of Lorem Ipsum or Gibberish placeholder text and random images using two data services (randomtext.me and lorempixel.com) to retrieve data and LoremPixel for getting random images from multiple different categories.

== Description ==

Hipsum Pixel brings the power of two data services into a single WordPress plugin. "RandomText" grabs dummy text in either Lorem Ipsum or Gibberish format, and "LoremPixel" gets randoms images in multiple different categories.  Hipster Pixel let's format the content using HTML tags (p, ol, ul, and h1-h4).  For images, you can set width and height and native WordPress classes for positioning (left, right, center).

*   Add button to editor, which opens a lightbox window with UI
*   Generate Lorem Ipsum or Gibberish content in HTML tags (p, ol, ul, h1-h4)
*   Generate random images in color or grayscale and from multiple different categories
*   Configurable number of HTML elements and number of words per element
*   Configurable image width and height and alignment using native WordPress classes (left, right, center)
*   Preview results before inserting into post

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
