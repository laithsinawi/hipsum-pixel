Creates a button on the WordPress editor toolbar to insert a configurable amount of Lorem Ipsum or Gibberish placeholder text and random images using two data services (randomtext.me and lorempixel.com) to retrieve data and LoremPixel for getting random images from multiple different categories.

Hipsum Pixel brings the power of two data services into a single WordPress plugin. "RandomText" grabs dummy text in either Lorem Ipsum or Gibberish format, and "LoremPixel" gets randoms images in multiple different categories.
